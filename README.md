### A database capable of searching and storing any book by name, author, and ISBN
### Click on "Add Book" to add a book to the database. It will then show up on the homepage as part of a list.
### Books on the list can be searched for through any field. When a book is found, it can be edited or removed.
### Books are not validated based on the existence of a real book. However, formatting for each field must be valid.
### This took a massive amount of time and taught me many important lessons for full-stack development
### This project was made using HTML, Heroku, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.js, and MongoDB
### Initially the project did not seem to have many problems. However, coming back 2 years later, the ISBN validation seems to be unstable.
### This was my final project for my Netcentric Computing course. It taught me about back-end programming and RESTful API. It accumulated everything I had learned throughout the quarter into one massive project and helped me organize my thoughts about Netcentric Computing as a whole.
### If I were to redo this project, I would make the interface more user-friendly. In addition, I would ensure the validation stays stable throughout the lifetime of the project. I have learned more about website development in my years after finishing this project and would like to make the list feel smoother.
