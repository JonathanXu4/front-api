A database capable of searching and storing any book by name, author, and ISBN

Click on "Add Book" to add a book to the database. It will then show up on the homepage as part of a list.

Books on the list can be searched for through any field. When a book is found, it can be edited or removed.

Books are not validated based on the existence of a real book. However, formatting for each field must be valid.
